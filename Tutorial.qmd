Here is how you use my package:

```{python}
from weather_package.analysis import add

print(add(2, 19))
```


```{python}
from weather_package import run_analysis_pipeline, run_cleaning_pipeline

df_clean = run_cleaning_pipeline(
    url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_North_American_ski_resorts",
    email="wella2@byu.edu"
)
run_analysis_pipeline(df_clean)
```
